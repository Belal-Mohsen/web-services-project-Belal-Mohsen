The holistic learning of the course will be evaluated through the term project in which a team of 2-3 students should design and implement an API Service website from scratch.

At the end of the term, each team needs to submit a project report, present their ideas and also demonstrate the app to the teacher/class. A team of three students (max) would be considered a team. There will be three deliverables.

Team members present their web API server idea (PowerPoint) and design the prototype of the application.

The PowerPoint presents the title of the project, team members, description of the project, chosen database (if any), and mock-up that depicts the entire navigation of the website.
